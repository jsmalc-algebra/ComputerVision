This is my submission for the Computer Vision project
I was forced to ommit the custom model saved after project_Scratch training as well as the dataset which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset which will be unsorted/unfit for use with YOLO
The test portion of it was sorted according to ttthe submission csv of https://www.kaggle.com/code/keakohv/genai-image-detection-kea-kohv-solution due to kaggle not giving ground truths for the test set in competitions
