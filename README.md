This is my submission for the Computer Vision project
I was forced to ommit the saved custom model as well as the dataset which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset
The dataset will hwoever be unsroted/unfit for use with yolo
The test portion of it was sorted according to ttthe submission csv of https://www.kaggle.com/code/keakohv/genai-image-detection-kea-kohv-solution due to kaggle not giving ground truths for the test set in competitions
